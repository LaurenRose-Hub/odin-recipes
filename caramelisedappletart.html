    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200C. Line a large baking tray with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Combine apple, sugar, cinnamon and lemon juice in a large bowl. Set aside for 10 mins to develop the flavours.</li>
        <li>Place pastry on prepared tray. Use a small knife to score a 1cm border around the edge (donâ€™t cut all the way through). Use a fork to prick centre of pastry several times. Layer apple, overlapping slightly, on pastry. Reserve juices in bowl. Bake for 20 mins or until pastry is golden and apple is just tender. Brush with a little of the reserved juices.
